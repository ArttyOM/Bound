#Bound 
This game was created on Unity3d for GGJ2018 in 48 hours, 
so there may be swarms of bugs. Project architecture is awful too.=)



Rules: 

Can be played by 1 or 2 players as Wizard and Warrior, 
each one with his own set of unique abilities.



Use mouse for moving Warrior, left click to perform an attack, right click to use mage as rotating weapon

.
Use WASD for moving Wizard, Space - cast fireball, E - aggro, R - confuse enemies 
(Warning! Warrior will be confused too!), 
Q - revenge warrior for rotation



Victory condition:
 Destroy all enemy towers (to destroy the one, you should stand beneath it for 3 seconds)
.
